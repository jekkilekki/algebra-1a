### 11-3 (Monday)

Four functions:
* Exponential growth: y = a(1 + r)^t
* Exponential decay: y = a(1 - r)^t
* Compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^nt
* Half-life: A = P(0.5)^t

1. Exponential growth
2. y = 12000(1.06)^t = $15149.72
3. y = 300(1.08)^t = 441 student-athletes
4. A = 1500(1.035)^t = $1721.28
5. A = 4200(1.007)^4t = $4965.43
6. y = 18000(0.88)^t = $5013.02
7. y = 10(0.84)^t = 4.98mg
8. A = 30(0.5)^t = 3.75g
9. A = 44(0.5)^t = 5.5g
10. y = 149000(1.06)^t = $224040.91
11. y = 1600(1.03)^t = 2150 people
12. A = 700(1.012)^t = $770.09
13. A = 30(1.078)^t = 47 members
14. A = 28000(1.04)^t = $34066.28
15. A = 7000(1.0075)^4t = $9438.44
16. A = 3500(1.0015)^12t = $3761.09
17. A = 12000(1.026)^t = $17635.66
18. y = 18000(0.98)^t = 15945 people
19. y = 58(0.9)^t = $24.97
20. y = 80(0.5)^t = 5g
